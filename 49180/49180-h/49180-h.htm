<p>George Digby, Earl of Bristol, was the author of the
following play. He was, as Mr. Walpole<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> observes, "a
singular person, whose life was one contradiction. He
wrote against Popery, and embraced it; he was a zealous
opposer of the Court, and a sacrifice for it; was conscientiously
converted in the midst of his prosecution of
Lord Strafford, and was most unconscientiously a prosecutor
of Lord Clarendon. With great parts, he always
hurt himself and his friends; with romantic bravery,
he was always an unsuccessful commander. He spoke
for the Test Act, though a Roman Catholic; and addicted
himself to astrology on the birthday of true
philosophy." The histories of England abound with
the adventures of this inconsistent and eccentric nobleman
who, amongst his other pursuits, esteemed the
drama not unworthy of his attention. Downes, the
prompter,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> asserts that he wrote two plays between the
years 1662 and 1665, <em>made out of the Spanish</em>; one
called "'Tis better than it was," and the other entitled
"Worse and Worse." Whether either of these is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>present performance cannot now be ascertained. It is,
however, at least probable to be one of them with a
new title.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The same writer says he also joined with
Sir Samuel Tuke in the composition of "The Adventures
of Five Hours." "Elvira" was printed in the
year 1667, and Mr Walpole imagines that it occasioned
our author being introduced into Sir John Suckling's
Session of Poets, a conjecture which, however, will by
no means correspond with the time in which Lord
Bristol and Sir John Suckling are supposed to have
written the respective works before mentioned. From
the notice taken of him by Sir John Suckling as a poet,
he seems to have been the author of some pieces which
are now lost to the world.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> After a life, which at different
periods of it commanded both the respect and
contempt of mankind, and not unfrequently the same
sentiments at one time, he died, neither loved nor regretted
by any party, in the year 1676.</p>

<p>[A MS. note in one of the former editions says: "A
play of pure <em>intrigue</em>.&mdash;Style feeble and drawling.&mdash;Plot
extremely complicated, and quite unintelligible
without a most fixed attention, which, however, the
play has not merit enough to excite. <em>July 1819.</em>"]</p>

the head, when born. The vulgar opinion has
generally been, that every person possessed of one of these
<em>cauls</em>, whether originally belonging to him, or obtained by
purchase, would be fortunate, and escape dangers. "Lampridius
tells us, that the midwives sold <em>cauls</em> at a good price
to the advocates and pleaders of his time; it being an
opinion, that while they had this about them, they should
carry with them a force of persuasion which no judge could
withstand: the canons forbid the use of it, because some
witches and sorcerers, it seems, had abused it."&mdash;See
["Popular Antiquities of Great Britain," 1870, iii., 139-42.]
</p>
<p>
Sir T. Brown ("Vulgar Errors," b. v., ch. 21) quotes "the
life of Antonius delivered by Spartianus" on the subject.
The caul, a "sillyhow" (as Sir T. Brown terms it), is still
considered a preservative against danger, and especially
against drowning. Notices of the sale of them used to be daily
posted on the Royal Exchange, and they are bought by captains
of ships and others going to sea, and great prices given
for them. The <cite>Times</cite> newspaper of March 17, 1827, has
the following advertisement:&mdash;"A child's caul, well worth
&pound;20, to be sold for &pound;14. Apply at Academy," &amp;c.&mdash;<cite>Collier.</cite></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry Cary</span>, <span class="smcap">Viscount Falkland</span>, was the son of
him who is commonly called the Great Lord Falkland.
He was a person very eminent for his extraordinary
parts and heroic spirit. When he was first elected to
serve in Parliament, some of the members opposed
his admission, urging that he had not sowed his
wild oats. "Then it will be the best way," replied
he, "to sow them in the House, where there are
geese enough to pick them up." He died in 1643,
being cut off in the prime of his years, as much
missed when dead, says Langbaine, as beloved when
living. I am informed from very good hands, that
it was he who wrote the epilogue to Lord Rochester's
"Valentinian." And I believe the same person
wrote the copy of verses, which is prefixed to Sandys'
tragedy, entitled, "Christ's Passion," translated, or
rather imitated, from the Latin of Hugo Grotius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">1st Judge.</span> My lord, here's none but knows
you, and I believe do grieve to see you stand thus,
and for a fact of such a bloody nature. A gentleman
of your fair hopes and fortunes, blood and
spirit, and other excellent parts, all cast upon
untimely hazards by such an act (as indeed I
know not how to name it). You needs must,
therefore, be worthy our grief; and I presume
you are not now to know the laws and
customs of this your country, with what religious
care they look unto the safety of our lives and
our estates, and with what strictness on perpetrations
of such a dye&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">2d Judge.</span> Especially, where innocent blood is
shed; and therefore we, being but the tongues of
the law (my lord), may hope you will interpret
the justice of it clearly from our mouths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">De F.</span> Please you, most reverend lords, is there
aught else but this I am to stand accused for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">2d Judge.</span> Not that we know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">De F.</span> Then, my good lords, you need not
labour much to find out circumstances to condemn
me; nor do I wish or think, my lords, to
satisfy the law by talking in my own defence.
Nor will I brand myself with such a fear, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
less hope, as to bespeak a melting tear. That
were to wish the act undone, and rob my justice
of a glory I would be torn to atoms for. No, I
come to meet the law; and if your wisdoms can
contract the spacious volumes of it into one doom,
I shall not startle, or divide my breast. My resolution
was above it, when first I undertook to be
my own law and judge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">1st Judge.</span> I grieve to hear this language from
you: it takes much from the man that you have
seemed, my lord; stain not your noble and religious
fame with such an atheism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">2d Judge.</span> Look back into the deed, my lord.
See, what a tide of blood pursues you, and breaks
upon your soul in angry seas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">De F.</span> Look back to our fame, grave lords, the
blood and honour of our family; nor think it my
vainglory to urge it here, since the cause does.
There has not yet, in all the ages it hath served
the state, one stain fallen on our escutcheon; and
although, my lords, these honours are derived to
us in a vast circle of time and blood, the passage
must be still through our veins, and so are treasured
here as heat in fire; so as the least taint in
us reflects a blush on the first virtue of our great
ancestors. And what has man called sacred but
his honour? That dwells not in the smiles of
Fortune; nor can she place the fool or coward in
that rank. And can your wisdoms think ours so
cheap, as to become the scorn of such?</p>

those that know you to hear your grief than
passion.</p>

<h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h3>


<p>Sir Samuel Tuke, of Temple Cressy, in the county
of Essex, was a colonel of horse in the king's army, and
served against the Parliament, as long as the affairs of
his master had any prospect of success. He was very
active in that rising in the county of Essex which
ended fatally to some of the chief actors in it. From
the prologue to the present play, spoken at court, it
appears that he intended to retire from business soon
after the Restoration, but was diverted from that design
for some time by his Majesty's recommending him
to adapt a Spanish play<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> to the English stage, which
he executed with some degree of success. On the 31st
March,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> 1664, he was created a baronet. He married
Mary, the daughter of Edward Sheldon, a lady who
was one of the dressers to Queen Mary, and probably a
Roman Catholic, of which persuasion our author seems
also to have been.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> He died at Somerset House, on the
26th of January 1673, and was buried in the vault
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>under the chapel there. Langbaine, by mistake, says
he was alive at the time he (Langbaine) published his
"Lives of the Dramatic Poets."</p>

<p>Sir Samuel did not escape the censure of his brother
poets.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> One of them, speaking of Cowley, says he</p>

<p class="center">Writ verses unjustly in praise of Sam Tuke.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
</p>

<p>And in the same poem&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sam Tuke sat, and formally smiled at the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Apollo, who well did his vanity know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call'd him to the bar to put him to the test,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But his muse was so stiff, she scarcely could go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She pleaded her age, desir'd a reward;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It seems in her age she doated on praise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Apollo resolv'd that such a bold bard<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Should never be grac'd with a per'wig of bays.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is some reason for assigning to Sir Samuel
Take part authorship of "Pompey the Great," which is
generally supposed to have been translated by Waller,
Lord Dorset, Sir C. Sedley, and Godolphin, and
printed in 1664. At the end of an edition of Sir John
Denham's poems, "printed by J. M. for H. Herringman,"
1684, is a catalogue of other works published by
the same bookseller, and among them this entry:&mdash;"By
Samuel Tuke, and several persons of honour.
Pompey."</p>

<p>Sir Samuel was one of the first members of the Royal
Society, and wrote a history of the ordering and generation
of green Colchester oysters, printed in Spratt's
"History," p. 307.</p>

<p>Since it is your pleasure, Noble Sir, that I should
hold my fortune from you, like those tenants, who
pay some inconsiderable trifle in lieu of a valuable
rent, I humbly offer you this poem, in acknowledgment
of my tenure: and I am well pleas'd
with this occasion to publish my sense of your
favours, since it seems to me a kind of ingratitude
to be thankful in private.</p>

<p>It was bred upon the terrace-walks in your garden
at Albury; and if I mistake not, it resembles
the place where it was brought up: the plot is
delightful, the elevations natural, the ascents easy,
without any great embellishments of art.</p>

<p>I designed the character of Antonio, as a copy
of your steady virtue; if it appear to those, who
have the honour to know you, short of the original,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>I take leave to inform them, that you have not sat
to me long; 'tis possible hereafter I may gratify
my country, for their civility to this essay, with
something more worthy of your patronage and
their indulgence.</p>

<p>In the interim, I make it my glory to avow that,
had Fortune been just to me, she could not have
recompensed the loyal industry of my life with a
more illustrious title than that which you have
been pleased to confer upon me, of Your Friend. To
which (as in gratitude I am bound) I subjoin that of</p>

<p class="center">Your most humble servant,</p>

<h3><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_THIRD_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_THIRD_EDITION">PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</a></h3>


<p>Having been desired by a lady, who has more than
ordinary favour for this play, though in other things
very judicious, to make a song, and insert it in that
scene where you may now read it, I found it more difficult
to disobey the commands of this excellent person,
than to obtain of myself to write any more upon subjects
of this nature.</p>

<p>This occasioned the revising of this piece, upon
which I had not cast my eyes since it was first
printed; and finding there some very obvious faults
(with respect to their judgments who have been
pleased to applaud it), I could not well imagine how
they came to escape my last hand; unless poetic rage,
or (in a more humble phrase) heat of fancy, will not at
the same time admit the calm temper of judgment; or
that, being importuned by those for whose benefit this
play was intended, I was even forced to expose it before
it was fit to be seen in such good company.</p>

<p>This refers only to the dress, for certainly the plot
needs no apology; it was taken out of Don Pedro Calderon,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
a celebrated Spanish author, the nation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>world who are the happiest in the force and delicacy of
their inventions, and recommended to me by his sacred
majesty as an excellent design, whose judgment is no
more to be doubted than his commands to be disobeyed.
And therefore it might be a great presumption
in me to enter my sentiments with his royal suffrage;
but as secretaries of state subscribe their names to the
mandates of their prince, so at the bottom of the leaf
I take the boldness to sign my opinion, that this is
incomparably the best plot that I ever met with. And
yet, if I may be allowed to do myself justice, I might
acquaint the readers that there are several alterations
in the copy which do not disgrace the original.</p>

<p>I confess, 'tis something new that trifles of this
nature should have a second edition; but if in truth
this essay be at present more correct, I have then
found an easy way to gratify their civility who have
been pleased to indulge the errors in the former impressions.</p>

<p>If they who have formerly seen or read this play
should not perceive the amendments, then I have
touched the point, since the chiefest art in writing is
the concealing of art; and they who discover 'em, and
are pleased with them, are indebted only to themselves
for their new satisfaction, since their former favour to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>our negligent Muses has occasioned their appearing
again in a more studied dress; and certainly those
labours are not ungrateful with which the writers and
readers are both pleased.</p>

<p>And since I am upon the subject of novelties, I take
the boldness to advertise the reader that, though it be
unusual, I have in a distinct column prefixed the
several characters of the most eminent persons in the
play, that, being acquainted with them at his first setting
out, he may the better judge how they are carried
on in the whole composition. For, plays being moral
pictures, their chiefest perfections consist in the force
and congruity of passions and humours, which are the
features and complexion of our minds; and I cannot
choose but hope that he will approve the ingenuity of
this design, though possibly he may dislike the painting.</p>

<p>As for those who have been so angry with this innocent
piece, not guilty of so much as that current wit&mdash;obscenity
and profaneness&mdash;these are to let them know
that, though the author converses with but few, he
writes to all; and aiming as well at the delight as
profit of his readers, if there be any amongst them who
are pleased to enter their haggard muses at so mean a
quarry, they may freely use their poetic licence, for he
pretends not to any royalty on the mount of Parnassus;
and I dare answer for him, that he will sing no more
till he comes into that choir where there is room enough
for all; and such, he presumes, is the good-breeding of
these critics, that they will not be so unmannerly as to
crowd him there.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Farewell.</span></p>

born at Madrid, of a good family, in 1601. Like Lope de Vega,
his contemporary, he signalised his dramatic genius at a
very early date, producing his "Carro del Cielo" at the age
of thirteen. He devoted the better part of his life to the
military profession, but afterwards took holy orders, and
became a canon of Toledo. He is supposed to have died in
1681. His plays were printed at Madrid between 1683 and
1691, in 9 vols. 4<sup>o</sup>; but the best edition, according to
Brunet, is that published at Madrid, 1760-63, 11 vols. 4<sup>o</sup>.
Some of Calderon's dramas were never printed, and have
perished.]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> This play, in the third edition from which it is here
printed, received some additions and improvements. The first
performance of it was at court; and on its appearance on the
stage at the Duke's Theatre it met with great applause, and
was acted thirteen nights successively. Echard, in the preface
to his translation of Terence, gives it this general character,
that it "is one of the pleasantest stories that ever
appeared upon our stage, and has as much variety of plots
and intrigues, without anything being precipitated, improper
or unnatural, as to the main action." In the year 1767, Mr
Hull made some alterations in it, with which it was acted at
Covent Garden Theatre about nine nights, under the title of
"The Perplexities." To the second edition were prefixed
complimentary verses by James Long, J. Evelyn, A. Cowley
Jasper Nedham, M.D., Lod. Carlile, Chr. Wase, William
Joyner, and one copy signed Melpomene. In Sir Wm.
Davenant's Works, p. 339, is a prologue written by him,
addressed to the Lord Chancellor, on the acting of this play
at the Inner Temple.</p></div>

surprised by Count Lodowicke, who fortified himself in it,
intending to hold it against the power of Spain. It was soon
after invested by the Duke of Alva, and surrendered to him
after a long siege, notwithstanding the Prince of Orange,
who came before it with an army, with which he some time
harassed his enemy, but without effecting his principal
design.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some, as soon as th' enter, we wish 'em gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taking their visit as a visitation:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet when they go, there are certain grimaces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Which in plain English, is but making faces)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we, for manners' sake, to all allow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poet's parting; don't rise, but smile and bow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And's back being turn'd, ye may take the liberty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To turn him, and all h' has writ to raillery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, as I shall be sav'd, were I as you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd make no bones on't&mdash;why, 'tis but his due.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fop! in this brave, licentious age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring his musty morals on the stage?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rhyme us to reason, and our lives redress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In metre, as Druids did the savages?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Affront the freeborn vices of the nation?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring dull virtue into reputation?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue! would any man of common sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pretend to't? why, virtue now is impudence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such another modest play would blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our new stage, and put your palates out of taste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We told him, Sir, 'tis whisper'd in the pit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This may be common sense, but 'tis not wit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That has a flaming spirit, and stirs the blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's bawdry, said he, if rightly understood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which our late poets make their chiefest tasks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if they writ only to th' vizard-masks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor that poetic rage, which hectors heaven,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Your writer's style, like's temper, 's grown more even;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he's afraid to shock their tender ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose God, say they, 's the fiction of their fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your moral's to no purpose. He replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some men talk'd idly just before they died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet we heard them with respect. 'Twas all he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, we may count him now as good as dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since ghosts have left walking, if you please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll let our virtuous poet rest in peace.<br /></span>

metre correspondingly corrupt. In the present reprint the

<p>This tract is said to have been the production of
James Wright of New Inn, afterwards of the Middle
Temple, Barrister-at-Law, who was the son of Abraham
Wright, a well-known miscellaneous writer (1645-70).
The former was the author of "The Antiquities of Rutlandshire,"
and some poems; particularly (1) "An
Essay on the Present Ruins of St Paul's Cathedral." To
which is annexed, "The Misfortunes of St Paul's
Cathedral," in heroic verse, 4<sup>o</sup>. 1668; reprinted with
two other poems under the title of (2) "Three poems
of St Paul's Cathedral; viz., The Ruins, The Rebuilding,
The Choire,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Fo. 1697," and (3) "Ph&#339;nix Paulina,
a Poem on St Paul's Cathedral, 4<sup>o</sup>. 1709."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> He was
alive in 1710, being mentioned by Mr Hearne in his
preface to Leland's "Itinerary," in this manner; "I
could have supply'd more Lacun&aelig;, and in all likelyhood
have render'd this performance more perfect, if I had
had the use of a very good transcript of Mr Leland's
'Itinerary,' taken about the time of Queen Elizabeth
(before the originals took wet, as is suppos'd) and
was formerly in possession of James Wright, of the
Middle Temple, Esq., the worthy author of the 'Antiquities
of Rutlandshire;' but this, with a multitude of
other valuable curiosities, was unhappily burned in the
fire at the Middle Temple, in the year 1698, as Mr
Wright has been pleased to inform me." Anthony
Wood says, he wrote an elegy on the death of Mr John
Goad, Master of Merchant Taylor's School, who died
1689. (See Wood's "Athen&aelig;," vol. i. p. 839.)</p>

<p>Much has been writ of late <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em> about the stage,
yet the subject admits of more, and that which has not
been hitherto touched upon; not only what that is, but
what it was, about which some people have made such
a bustle. What it is we see, and I think it has been
sufficiently displayed in Mr Collier's book; what it was
in former ages, and how used in this kingdom, so far
back as one may collect any memorials, is the subject
of the following dialogue. Old plays will be always
read by the curious, if it were only to discover the
manners and behaviour of several ages, and how they
altered. For plays are exactly like portraits, drawn in
the garb and fashion of the time when painted. You
see one habit in the time of Charles I., another quite
different from that, both for men and women, in
Queen Elizabeth's time; another under Henry VIII.
different from both; and so backward, all various.
And in the several fashions of behaviour and conversation
there is as much mutability as in that of clothes.
Religion and religious matters were once as much the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
mode in public entertainments as the contrary has been
in some times since. This appears in the different plays
of several ages: and to evince this the following sheets
are an essay or specimen.</p>

<p>Some may think the subject of this discourse trivial,
and the persons herein mentioned not worth remembering.
But besides that I could name some things
contested of late with great heat, of as little or less consequence,
the reader may know that the profession of
players is not so totally scandalous, nor all of them so
reprobate, but that there has been found under that
name a canonised saint in the primitive church, as may
be seen in the "Roman Martyrology" on the 29th March:
his name <em>Masculas</em>, a master of interludes (the Latin is
<i lang="la">Archimimus</i>, and the French translation <i lang="fr">un Ma&icirc;tre comedien</i>)
who, under the persecution of the Vandals in
Africa by Geisericus the Aryan king, having endured
many and grievous torments and reproaches for the
confession of the truth, finished the course of this glorious
combat, saith the said "Martyrology."</p>

<p>It appears from this and some further instances in
the following discourse, that there have been players of
worthy principles as to religion, loyalty, and other virtues;
and if the major part of them fall under a different
character, it is the general unhappiness of mankind,
that the <em>most</em> are the <em>worst.</em></p>

genius, so are the plays; but, in my opinion, they
are all of 'em (some few excepted) as much inferior
to those of former times, as the actors now in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
being (generally speaking) are, compared to Hart,
Mohun, Burt, Lacy, Clun, and Shatterel; for I
can reach no farther backward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> I can, and dare assure you, if my fancy
and memory are not partial (for men of my age
are apt to be over-indulgent to the thoughts of
their youthful days), I say the actors that I have
seen before the wars&mdash;Lowin, Taylor, Pollard, and
some others&mdash;were almost as far beyond Hart and
his company as those were beyond these now in
being.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> I am willing to believe it, but cannot
readily; because I have been told that those
whom I mentioned were bred up under the others
of your acquaintance, and followed their manner
of action, which is now lost: so far that, when
the question has been asked why these players do
not revive the "Silent Woman" and some other
of Jonson's plays (once of highest esteem), they
have answered, "Truly, because there are none
now living who can rightly humour those parts;
for all who related to the Blackfriars (where they
were acted in perfection) are now dead and almost
forgotten."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> 'Tis very true, Hart and Clun were bred
up boys at the Blackfriars, and acted women's
parts. Hart was Robinson's boy or apprentice;
he acted the Duchess in the tragedy of the "Cardinal,"
which was the first part that gave him
reputation. Cartwright and Wintershal belonged
to the Private House in Salisbury Court; Burt
was a boy, first under Shank at the Blackfriars,
then under Beeston at the Cockpit; and Mohun
and Shatterel were in the same condition with
him at the last place. There Burt used to play
the principal women's parts, in particular Clariana,
in "Love's Cruelty;" and at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
Mohun acted Bellamente, which part he retained
after the Restoration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> That I have seen, and can well remember.
I wish they had printed in the last age (so
I call the times before the Rebellion) the actors'
names over against the parts they acted, as they
have done since the Restoration, and thus one
might have guessed at the action of the men by
the parts which we now read in the old plays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> It was not the custom and usage of those
days, as it hath been since. Yet some few old
plays there are that have the names set against
the parts, as "The Duchess of Malfy," "The
Picture," "The Roman Actor," "The Deserving
Favourite," "The Wild-Goose Chase" (at the
Blackfriars), "The Wedding," "The Renegado,"
"The Fair Maid of the West," "Hannibal
and Scipio," "King John and Matilda" (at the
Cockpit), and "Holland's Leaguer" (at Salisbury
Court).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> These are but few indeed. But pray, sir,
what master-parts can you remember the old
Blackfriar's men to act in Jonson, Shakespeare,
and Fletcher's plays?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> What I can at present recollect, I'll tell
you. Shakespeare (who, as I have heard, was a
much better poet than player), Burbage, Hemmings,
and others of the older sort, were dead
before I knew the town; but in my time, before
the wars, Lowin used to act with mighty applause
Falstaff, Morose, Volpone, and Mammon
in the "Alchymist," Melantius in the "Maid's
Tragedy;" and at the same time Amyntor was
played by Stephen Hammerton (who was at first a
most noted and beautiful woman-actor, but afterwards
he acted with equal grace and applause a
young lover's part); Taylor acted Hamlet incom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>parably
well; Jago, Truewit in the "Silent
Woman," and Face in the "Alchymist." Swanston
used to play Othello. Pollard and Robinson were
comedians; so was Shank, who used to act Sir
Roger in the "Scornful Lady:" these were of
Blackfriars. Those of principal note at the
Cockpit were Perkins, Michael Bowyer, Sumner,
William Allan, and Bird, eminent actors, and
Robins, a comedian. Of the other companies I
took little notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> Were there so many companies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> Before the wars there were in being all
these play-houses at the same time. The Blackfriars
and Globe on the Bank-side, a winter and
summer house, belonging to the same company,
called the King's Servants; the Cockpit or Ph&#339;nix,
in Drury Lane, called the Queen's Servants; the
Private House, in Salisbury Court, called the
Prince's Servants; the Fortune, near Whitecross
Street;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and the Red Bull, at the upper end of St
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>John's Street: the two last were mostly frequented
by citizens and the meaner sort of people. All
these companies got money, and lived in reputation,
especially those of the Blackfriars, who were
men of grave and sober behaviour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> Which I admire at; that the town, much
less than at present, could then maintain five
companies, and yet now two can hardly subsist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> Do not wonder, but consider that, though
the town was then, perhaps, not much more than
half so populous as now, yet then the prices were
small (there being no scenes), and better order kept
among the company that came; which made very
good people think a play an innocent diversion for
an idle hour or two, the plays themselves being
then, for the most part, more instructive and
moral. Whereas, of late, the play-houses are so
extremely pestered with vizard-masks and their
trade (occasioning continual quarrels and abuses),
that many of the more civilised part of the
town are uneasy in the company, and shun the
theatre as they would a house of scandal. It is an
argument of the worth of the plays and actors of the
last age, and easily inferred, that they were much
beyond ours in this, to consider that they could
support themselves merely from their own merit,
the weight of the matter, and goodness of the action,
without scenes and machines; whereas the
present plays, with all that show, can hardly draw
an audience, unless there be the additional invitation
of a Signer Fedeli, a Monsieur l'Abb&eacute;, or
some such foreign regale expressed in the bottom
of the bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> To waive this digression, I have read of
one Edward Alleyn, a man so famed for excellent
action, that among Ben Jonson's epigrams I find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
one directed to him, full of encomium, and concluding
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Wear this renown; 'tis just that who did give</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>So many poets life, by one should live.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Was he one of the Blackfriars?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> Never as I have heard (for he was dead
before my time). He was master of a company
of his own, for whom he built the Fortune Playhouse
from the ground, a large round brick
building. This is he that grew so rich, that he
purchased a great estate in Surrey and elsewhere;
and having no issue, he built and largely endowed
Dulwich College in the year 1619<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, for a master, a
warden, four fellows, twelve aged poor people,
and twelve poor boys, &amp;c. A noble charity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> What kind of play-houses had they before
the wars?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> The Blackfriars, Cockpit, and Salisbury
Court were called private houses, and were very
small to what we see now. The Cockpit was
standing since the Restoration, and Rhodes's company
acted there for some time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> I have seen that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> Then you have seen the other two in
effect, for they were all three built almost exactly
alike for form and bigness. Here they had pits
for the gentry, and acted by candlelight. The
Globe, Fortune, and Bull were large houses, and
lay partly open to the weather, and there they
always acted by daylight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> But prythee, Trueman, what became of
these players when the stage was put down, and
the Rebellion raised?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> Most of them, except Lowin, Taylor, and
Pollard (who were superannuated) went into the
king's army, and, like good men and true, served their
old master, though in a different, yet more honourable
capacity. Robinson was killed at the taking
of a place (I think Basing House) by Harrison, he
that was after hanged at Charing Cross, who refused
him quarter, and shot him in the head
when he had laid down his arms; abusing Scripture
at the same time in saying, <em>Cursed is he that
doth the work of the Lord negligently</em>. Mohun was
a captain, and (after the wars were ended here)
served in Flanders, where he received pay as a
major. Hart was a lieutenant of horse under Sir
Thomas Dallison, in Prince Rupert's regiment;
Burt was cornet in the same troop, and Shatterel
quartermaster. Allen of the Cockpit was a major,
and quartermaster-general at Oxford. I have not
heard of one of these players; of any note that
sided with the other party, but only Swanston;
and he professed himself a Presbyterian, took up
the trade of a jeweller, and lived in Aldermanbury,
within the territory of Father Calamy. The rest
either lost or exposed their lives for their king.
When the wars were over, and the Royalists
totally subdued, most of 'em who were left alive
gathered to London, and for a subsistence endeavoured
to revive their old trade privately. They
made up one company out of all the scattered
members of several; and in the winter before the
king's murder, 1648, they ventured to act some
plays, with as much caution and privacy as could
be, at the Cockpit. They continued undisturbed
for three or four days; but at last, as they were
presenting the tragedy of the "Bloody Brother"
(in which Lowin acted Aubery: Taylor, Rollo;
Pollard, the Cook; Burt, Latorch; and, I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
Hart, Otto), a party of foot-soldiers beset the
house, surprised 'em about the middle of the
play,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and carried 'em away in their habits, not
admitting them to shift, to Hatton House, then a
prison, where, having detained them some time,
they plundered them of their clothes, and let 'em
loose again. Afterwards, in Oliver's time, they
used to act privately, three or four miles, or more,
out of town, now here, now there: sometimes in
noblemen's houses, in particular, Holland House
at Kensington, where the nobility and gentry who
met (but in no great numbers) used to make
a sum for them, each giving a broad piece, or
the like. And Alexander Goffe, the woman-actor
at Blackfriars (who had made himself known to
persons of quality), used to be the jackal, and give
notice of time and place. At Christmas and Bartholomew
Fair, they used to bribe the officer who
commanded the guard at Whitehall, and were
thereupon connived at to act for a few days at the
Red Bull,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> but were sometimes, notwithstanding,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>disturbed by soldiers. Some picked up a little
money by publishing the copies of plays never
before printed, but kept up in manuscript. For
instance, in the year 1652, Beaumont and Fletcher's
"Wild-Goose Chase" was printed in folio, for the
public use of all the ingenious, as the title-page
says, and private benefit of John Lowin and Joseph
Taylor, servants to his late majesty; and by them
dedicated to the honoured few lovers of dramatic
poesy, wherein they modestly intimate their wants,
and that with sufficient cause; for whatever they
were before the wars, they were after reduced to a
necessitous condition. Lowin, in his latter days,
kept an inn, the Three Pigeons at Brentford, where
he died very old, for he was an actor of eminent
note in the reign of King James I.; and his poverty
was as great as his age. Taylor died at Richmond,
and was there buried. Pollard, who lived single,
and had a competent estate, retired to some relations
he had in the country, and there ended his
life. Perkins and Sumner of the Cockpit kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>house together at Clerkenwell, and were there
buried. These all died some years before the Restoration;
what followed after, I need not tell you;
you can easily remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> Yes; presently after the Restoration,
the king's players acted publicly at the Red Bull
for some time, and then removed to a new-built
play-house in Vere Street, by Clare Market. There
they continued for a year or two, and then removed
to the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, where they
first made use of scenes, which had been a little
before introduced upon the public stage by Sir
William Davenant, at the Duke's Old Theatre in
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, but afterwards very much
improved, with the addition of curious machines,
by Mr Betterton, at the New Theatre in Dorset
Garden, to the great expense and continual charge
of the players. This much impaired their profit
o'er what it was before; for I have been informed
by one of 'em, that for several years next after the
Restoration every whole sharer in Mr Hart's company
got &pound;1000 <i lang="la">per ann.</i> About the same time
that scenes first entered upon the stage at London,
women were taught to act their own parts; since
when we have seen at both houses several actresses,
justly famed, as well for beauty as perfect good
action. And some plays, in particular the "Parson's
Wedding," have been presented all by women,
as formerly all by men. Thus it continued for
about twenty years, when Mr Hart, and some of the
old men, began to grow weary, and were minded
to leave off. Then the two companies thought fit
to unite; but of late, you see, they have thought it
no less fit to divide again, though both companies
keep the same name of His Majesty's Servants. All
this while the play-house music improved yearly,
and is now arrived to greater perfection than ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
I knew it. Yet for all these advantages, the reputation
of the stage and people's affection to it are
much decayed. Some were lately severe against
it, and would hardly allow stage-plays fit to be
longer permitted. Have you seen Mr Collier's
book?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> Yes, and his opposers'.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> And what think you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> In my mind, Mr Collier's reflections are
pertinent, and true in the main; the book ingeniously
wrote, and well intended; but he has overshot
himself in some places, and his respondents
perhaps in more. My affection inclines me not to
engage on either side, but rather mediate. If
there be abuses relating to the stage&mdash;which, I
think, is too apparent&mdash;let the abuse be reformed,
and not the use, for that reason only, abolished.
'Twas an old saying, when I was a boy&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i lang="la">Absit abusus, non desit totaliter usus.</i>
</p>

<p>I shall not run through Mr Collier's book; I will
only touch a little on two or three general notions,
in which, I think, he may be mistaken. What he
urges out of the primitive councils and fathers of
the Church seems to me to be directed against the
heathen plays, which were a sort of religious worship
with them, to the honour of Ceres, Flora, or
some of their false deities. They had always a
little altar on their stages, as appears plain enough
from some places in Plautus. And Mr Collier
himself, p. 235, tells us out of Livy that plays
were brought in, upon the score of religion, to
pacify the gods. No wonder, then, they forbid
Christians to be present at them, for it was almost
the same as to be present at their sacrifices. We
must also observe that this was in the infancy of
Christianity, when the Church was under severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
and almost continual persecutions, and when all its
true members were of most strict and exemplary
lives, not knowing when they should be called to
the stake, or thrown to wild beasts. They communicated
daily, and expected death hourly; as
their thoughts were intent upon the next world,
they abstained almost wholly from all diversions
and pleasures (though lawful and innocent) in this.
Afterwards, when persecution ceased, and the
Church flourished, Christians, being then freed from
their former terrors, allowed themselves, at proper
times, the lawful recreations of conversations, and
among other, no doubt, this of shows and representations.
After this time, the censures of the
Church indeed might be continued or revived upon
occasion against plays and players; though, in my
opinion, it cannot be understood generally, but
only against such players who were of vicious and
licentious lives, and represented profane subjects,
inconsistent with the morals and probity of manners
requisite to Christians, and frequented chiefly
by such loose and debauched people as were much
more apt to corrupt than divert those who associated
with them. I say, I cannot think the canons
and censures of the fathers can be applied to all
players, <em>quatenus</em> players; for if so, how could
plays be continued among the Christians, as they
were, of divine subjects and scriptural stories? A
late French author, speaking of the Hotel de Bourgogne,
a play-house in Paris, says that the ancient
dukes of that name gave it to the Brotherhood of
the Passion, established in the church of Trinity
Hospital, in the Rue St Denis, on condition that
they should represent here interludes of devotion;
and adds, that there have been public shows in
this place six hundred years ago. The Spanish
and Portuguese continue still to have, for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
part, such ecclesiastical stories for the subject of
their plays; and if we may believe Gage, they are
acted in their churches in Mexico and the Spanish
West Indies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> That's a great way off, Trueman; I had
rather you would come nearer home, and confine
your discourse to Old England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> So I intend. The same has been done
here in England; for otherwise, how comes it to
be prohibited in the 88th Canon, among those
passed in convocation, 1603? Certain it is that
our ancient plays were of religious subjects, and
had for their actors, if not priests, yet men relating
to the Church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> How does that appear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> Nothing clearer. Stow, in his "Survey
of London," has one chapter <cite>Of the Sports and Pastimes
of old time used in this City</cite>; and there he
tells us, that in the year 1391, which was 15
Richard II., a stage-play was played by the parish
clerks of London, at the Skinner's Well beside
Smithfield, which play continued three days together,
the king, queen, and nobles of the realm
being present. And another was played in the
year 1409, 11 Henry IV., which lasted eight days,
and was of matter from the creation of the world,
whereat were present most part of the nobility
and gentry of England. Sir William Dugdale, in
his "Antiquities of Warwickshire," p. 116, speaking
of the Grayfriars or Franciscans at Coventry,
says: "Before the suppression of the monasteries,
this city was very famous for the pageants that
were played therein upon Corpus-Christi Day;
which pageants, being acted with mighty state
and reverence by the friars of this house, had
theatres for the several scenes very large and
high, placed upon wheels, and drawn to all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
eminent parts of the city, for the better advantage
of the spectators, and contained the story
of the New Testament, composed in old English
rhyme." An ancient manuscript of the same is
now to be seen in the Cottonian Library, <cite>Sub
Effig. Vesp. D. 8</cite>. Since the Reformation, in
Queen Elizabeth's time, plays were frequently
acted by quiristers and singing-boys; and several
of our old comedies have printed in the title-page,
"acted by the children of Paul's" (not the school,
but the church); others, "by the children of
her majesty's chapel:" in particular, "Cynthia's
Revels" and "The Poetaster" were played by
them, who were at that time famous for good
action. Among Ben Jonson's epigrams you may
find an epitaph on S. P. (<cite>Sal. Pavy</cite>), one of the
children of Queen Elizabeth's chapel, part of
which runs thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Years he counted scarce thirteen,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><em>When fates turn'd cruel,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Yet three fill'd zodiacs he had been</em><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><em>As, sooth, the Parc&aelig; thought him one,</em><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Some of these chapel-boys, when they grew
men, became actors at the Blackfriars; such were
Nathan. Field<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and John Underwood. Now I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>can hardly imagine that such plays and players as
these are included in the severe censure of the
councils and fathers; but such only who are truly
within the character given by Didacus de Tapia, cited
by Mr Collier, p. 276, viz., <em>The infamous playhouse;
a place of contradiction to the strictness and sobriety
of religion; a place hated by God, and haunted by the
devil</em>. And for such I have as great an abhorrence
as any man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> Can you guess of what antiquity the representing
of religious matters on the stage hath
been in England?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> How long before the Conquest, I know
not, but that it was used in London not long after,
appears by Fitz-Stephen, an author who wrote in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>the reign of King Henry the Second.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> His words
are, <i lang="la">Londonia pro spectaculis theatralibus, pro ludis
scenicis, ludos habet sanctiores, representationes miraculorum,
qu&aelig; sancti confessores operati sunt, seu repr&aelig;sentationes
passionum quibus claruit constantia
martyrum</i>. Of this the manuscript which I lately
mentioned, in the Cottonian library, is a notable
instance. Sir William Dugdale cites this manuscript
by the title of <cite>Ludus Coventri&aelig;</cite>; but in the
printed Catalogue of that library, p. 113, it is
named thus, A Collection of Plays in Old English
Metre; h. e. <i lang="la">Dramata sacra, in quibus exhibentur
histori&aelig; Veteris et N. Testamenti, introductis quasi
in scenam personis illic memoratis, quas secum invicem
colloquentes pro ingenio fingit poeta. Videntur olim
coram populo, sive ad instruendum, sive ad placendum,
a fratribus mendicantibus repr&aelig;sentata</i>. It appears
by the latter end of the prologue, that these plays
or interludes were not only played at Coventry,
but in the other towns and places upon occasion.
And possibly this may be the same play which
Stow tells us was played in the reign of King
Henry IV., which lasted for eight days. The book
seems by the character and language to be at least
300 years old. It begins with a general prologue,
giving the arguments of 40 pageants or gesticulations
(which were as so many several acts or scenes)
representing all the histories of both testaments,
from the creation to the choosing of St <em>Matthias</em> to
be an apostle. The stories of the New Testament
are more largely expressed, viz., the Annunciation,
Nativity, Visitation; but more especially all matters
relating to the Passion, very particularly, the
Resurrection, Ascension, the Choice of St <em>Matthias.</em>
After which is also represented the Assumption,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>and Last Judgment. All these things were treated
of in a very homely style, as we now think, infinitely
below the dignity of the subject; but it seems the
<em>go&ucirc;t</em> of that age was not so nice and delicate in
these matters; the plain and incurious judgment
of our ancestors being prepared with favour, and
taking everything by the right and easiest handle.
For example, in the scene relating to the Visitation:</p></div>

<p>These and such like were the plays, which in
former ages were presented publicly. Whether
they had any settled and constant houses for that
purpose, does not appear; I suppose not. But it
is notorious that in former times there was hardly
ever any solemn reception of princes or noble
persons, but pageants, that is, stages erected in the
open street, were part of the entertainment: on
which there were speeches by one or more persons,
in the nature of scenes; and be sure one of the
speakers must be some saint of the same name
with the party to whom the honour is intended.
For instance, there is an ancient manuscript at
Coventry, called the "Old Leet Book," wherein is
set down in a very particular manner, p. 168, the
reception of Queen Margaret, wife of Henry VI.
who came to Coventry; and, I think, with her
young son, Prince Edward, on the Feast of the
Exaltation of the Holy Cross, 35 Hen. VI. 1456.
Many pageants and speeches were made for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>

or three in the old English, as it is recorded:&mdash;</p></div>

<p>In the next reign, as appears in the same book,
fol. 221, another Prince Edward, son of King Edward
IV., came to Coventry on the 28th of April,
14 Edward IV. 1474, and was entertained with
many pageants and speeches, among which I shall
observe only two; one was of St Edward again,
who was then made to speak thus:&mdash;</p></div>

saith the book:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> I perceive these holy matters consisted
very much of praying; but I pity poor St Edward
the Confessor who, in the compass of a few years,
was made to promise his favour and assistance to
two young princes, of the same name indeed, but
of as different and opposite interests as the two
poles. I know not how he could perform to both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> Alas! they were both unhappy, notwithstanding
these fine shows and seeming caresses of
fortune; being both murdered, one by the hand,
the other by the procurement, of Richard, Duke
of Gloucester. I will produce but one example
more of this sort of action or representations; and
that is of later time, and an instance of much
higher nature than any yet mentioned; it was at
the marriage of Prince Arthur, eldest son of King
Henry VII., to the Princess Catherine of Spain,
ann. 1501. Her passage through London was
very magnificent, as I have read it described in
old MS. chronicle of that time.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The pageants
and speeches were many; the persons represented,
St Catherine, St Ursula, a senator, noblesse,
virtue, an angel, King Alphonse, Job, Boetius,

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> This would be censured now-a-days as
profane to the highest degree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> No doubt on't: yet you see there was a
time, when people were not so nicely censorious in
these matters, but were willing to take things in
the best sense; and then this was thought a noble
entertainment for the greatest king in Europe (such
I esteem king Henry VII. at that time) and proper
for that day of mighty joy and triumph. And I
must farther observe out of Lord Bacon's "History
of Henry VII." that the chief man who had the
care of that day's proceedings was Bishop Fox, a
grave counsellor for war or peace, and also a good
surveyor of works, and a good master of ceremonies;
and it seems he approv'd it. The said
Lord Bacon tells us farther that, whosoever had
those toys in compiling, they were not altogether
pedantical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> These things, however, are far from that
which we understand by the name of a play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> It may be so; but these were the plays of
those times. Afterwards, in the reign of King
Henry VIII., both the subject and form of these
plays began to alter, and have since varied more
and more. I have by me a thing called "A Merry
Play between the Pardoner and the Friar, the
Curate and Neighbour Pratt." Printed the 5th
of April 1533, which was 24 Henry VIII. (a few
years before the dissolution of monasteries.) The
design of this play was to ridicule Friars and Pardoners.
Of which I'll give you a taste. To begin
it, the Friar enters with these words:<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><em>I com not hyther for meat nor for meale,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>But I com hyther for your soules heale</em>, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After a long preamble he addresses himself to
preach, when the Pardoner enters with these
words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>God and St Leonarde send ye all his grace,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>As many as ben assembled in this place</em>, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and makes a long speech, showing his bulls and
his reliques, in order to sell his pardons, for the
raising some money towards the rebuilding</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Of the holy chappell of sweet saynt Leonarde,</em><br /></span>

at last they fall together by the ears.

<p>Here he calls his neighbour Prat, the constable,
with design to apprehend 'em, and set 'em in the
stocks. But the Friar and Pardoner prove sturdy,
and will not be stocked, but fall upon the poor
Parson and Constable, and bang them both so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
well-favouredly, that at last they are glad to let
'em go at liberty: and so the farce ends with a
drawn battle. Such as this were the plays of
that age, acted in gentlemen's halls at Christmas
or such like festival times by the servants of the
family or strollers who went about, and made it
a trade. It is not unlikely that the<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> lords in
those days and persons of eminent quality had
their several gangs of players, as some have now
of fiddlers, to whom they give cloaks and badges.
The first comedy that I have seen, that looks like
regular, is "Gammer Gurton's Needle," writ,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> I
think, in the reign of King Edward VI. This is
composed of five acts, the scenes unbroken, and
the unities of time and place duly observed. It
was acted at Christ's College in Cambridge,
there not being as yet any settled and public
theatres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> I observe, Trueman, from what you
have said, that plays in England had a beginning
much like those of Greece; the Monologues and
Pageants, drawn from place to place on wheels,
answer exactly to the cart of Thespis, and the
improvements have been by such little steps and
degrees as among the ancients, till at last, to use
the words of Sir George Buck (in his "Third
University of England"), "Dramatic poesy is so
lively express'd and represented upon the public
stages and theatres of this city, as Rome in the
auge (the highest pitch) of her pomp and glory,
never saw it better performed, I mean (says he)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>in respect of the action and art, and not of the
cost and sumptuousness." This he writ about the
year 1631. But can you inform me, Trueman,
when the public theatres were first erected for this
purpose in London?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> Not certainly; but I presume about the
beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign. For Stow,
in his "Survey of London" (which book was first
printed in the year 1598), says&mdash;"Of late years,
in place of these stage-plays (<em>i.e.</em>, those of religious
matters) have been used comedies, tragedies, interludes,
and histories, both true and feigned: for
the acting whereof certain public places, as the
Theatre, the Curtine, &amp;c., have been erected."
And the continuator of "Stow's Annals," p. 1004,
says that in sixty years before the publication of
that book (which was Ann. Dom. 1529), no less
than seventeen public stages, or common playhouses,
had been built in and about London. In
which number he reckons five inns or common
hostelries to have been in his time turned into
playhouses&mdash;one Cockpit, Saint Paul's Singing-school,
one in the Blackfriars, one in the Whitefriars,
and one in former time at Newington
Butts. And adds: Before the space of sixty years
past, I never knew, heard, or read of any such
theatres, stages, or playhouses, as have been purposely
built within man's memory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> After all, I have been told that stage-plays
are inconsistent with the laws of this kingdom,
and players made rogues by statute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> He that told you so strained a point of
truth. I never met with any law wholly to suppress
them: sometimes, indeed, they have been
prohibited for a season; as in times of Lent,
general mourning, or public calamities, or upon
other occasions, when the government saw fit.
Thus, by proclamation 7th of April, in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
year of Queen Elizabeth, plays and interludes were
forbid until All-hallow-tide next following. Hollinshed,
p. 1184.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Some statutes have been made
for their regulation or information, not general suppression.
By the stat. 39 Eliz. cap. 4<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> (which was
made for the suppression of rogues, vagabonds, and
sturdy beggars) it is enacted "<em>That all persons that
be, or utter themselves to be, proctors, procurers,
patent gatherers, or collectors for goals, prisons, or
hospitals, or fencers, bearwards, common players of
interludes and minstrels, wandering abroad (other
than players of interludes belonging to any baron of
this realm, or any other honourable personage of
greater degree, to be authoris'd to play under the
hand and seal of arms of such baron or personage)
all juglers, tinkers, pedlars, and petty chapmen,
wand'ring abroad, all wand'ring persons, &amp;c., able in
body, using loytering, and refusing to work for such
reasonable wages as is commonly given, &amp;c. These
shall be adjudged and deemed rogues, vagabonds, and
sturdy beggars, and punished as such</em>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> But this privilege of authorising or licensing
is taken away by the stat. Jac. I., ch. 7, s. 1.,
and therefore all of them, as Mr Collier says, p.
242, are expressly brought under the aforesaid
penalty without distinction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> If he means all players, without distinction,
'tis a great mistake. For the force of the
queen's statute extends only to wandering players,
and not to such as are the king or queen's servants,
and established in settled houses by royal
authority. On such the ill character of vagrant
players (or, as they are now called, strollers) can
cast no more aspersion, than the wandering proctors,
in the same statute mentioned, on those of

21, it was enacted, "<em>That if any person shall, in
any stage-play, interlude, shew, may-game or pageant,
jestingly or prophanely speak or use the holy name of
God, Christ Jesus, or of the Trinity, he shall forfeit

ch. 1,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> enacts, "<em>That no meetings, assemblies, or concourse
of people shall be out of their own parishes, on
the Lord's day, for any sports or pastime whatsoever,
nor any bear-baiting, bull-baiting, interludes, common-plays,
or other unlawful exercises and pastimes
used by any person or persons within their own,
parishes</em>." These are all the statutes that I can
think of, relating to the stage and players; but
nothing to suppress them totally, till the two
ordinances of the Long Parliament, one of the
22d of October 1647, the other of the 11th [9th]
of Feb. 1647;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> by which all stage-plays and interludes
are absolutely forbid; the stages, seats,
galleries, &amp;c., to be pulled down; all players, tho'
calling themselves the king or queen's servants, if
convicted of acting within two months before such
conviction, to be punished as rogues according to
law; the money received by them to go to the
poor of the parish; and every spectator to pay
five shillings to the use of the poor. Also cock-fighting
was prohibited by one of Oliver's Acts of
31st March 1654. But I suppose nobody pretends
these things to be laws. I could say more on this
subject, but I must break off here and leave you,
Lovewit; my occasions require it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> Farewell, old Cavalier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">True.</span> 'Tis properly said; we are almost all of
us now gone and forgotten.</p></div>

Mr Steevens supposes, from the extent of it, that all the
actors resided within its precincts. It was pulled down about
the time of the Restoration, soon after the appearance of the
following advertisement in the <cite>Mercurius Politicus</cite>, Tuesday,
Feb. 14, to Tuesday, Feb. 21, 1661. "The Fortune Playhouse,
situate between Whitecross Street and Golding
Square, in the parish of St Giles, Cripplegate, with the
ground thereunto belonging, is to be let to be built upon;
where twenty-three tenements may be erected, with gardens;
and a street may be cut through for the better accommodation
of the buildings." (See edition of Shakespeare,
1778, i. 267.) From the following passage of "The
English Traveller," by Heywood, 1633, sig. I 3, we find
there was a picture or statue of Fortune before the building.

by all, and they were the fittest for the actors to represent,
there being little cost in cloaths, which often were in great
danger to be seized by the then soldiers; who, as the poet
sayes, <em>Enter the red coat, exit hat and cloak</em>, was very true,
not only in the audience but the actors too, who were commonly
not only stripp'd, but many times imprisoned, till
they paid such ransom as the souldiers would impose upon
them: so that it was hazardous to act any thing that required
any good cloaths: instead of which painted cloath many
times served the turn to represent rich habits."</p></div>

actors forbidden to present us with any of their tragedies,
because we had enough of that in earnest: and
comedies, because the vices of the age were too lively and
smartly represented; then all that we could divert ourselves
with, were these humours and pieces of plays which, passing
under the name of a merry conceited fellow, called "Bottom
the Weaver," "Simpleton the Smith," "John Swabber," or
some such title, were only allowed us, and that but by stealth
too, and under pretence of rope-dancing or the like; and these
being all that was permitted us, great was the confluence of
the auditors; and these small things were as profitable and
as great get-pennies to the actors as any of our late famed
plays. I have seen <em>the Red Bull Playhouse</em>, which was a
large one, so full, that as many went back for want of room
as had entered; and as meanly as you may now think of
these drols, they were then acted by the best comedians then
and now in being; and I may say by some that then exceeded
all now living, by name, the incomparable Robert Cox, who
was not only the principal actor, but also the contriver and
author of most of these farces."&mdash;Kirkman's Preface to "The

to his "Woman is a Weathercock," &amp;c., xi. 3-6,
89-91, and Collier's "Memoirs of Actors," p. 206, <i lang="la">et seq.</i>]
</p>
<p>
Nathaniel Field, on the authority of Roberts the player
(see his answer to Mr Pope's preface to Shakespeare), has
been considered as the author of two plays: "A Woman is
a Weathercocke," 1612, and "Amends for Ladies," 1618.
He is also supposed to be the same person who assisted
Massinger in "The Fatal Dowry." I suspect that Roberts
was mistaken in these assertions, as I do not find any contemporary
writer speak of Field as an author; nor is it
mentioned by Langbaine, who would have noticed it, had he
known the fact. It seems more probable that the writer of
these plays was Nathaniel Field, M.A., Fellow of New College,
Oxford, who wrote some Latin verses, printed in
"Oxoniensis Academi&aelig; Parentalia, 1625," and who, being of
the same university with Massinger, might join with him,
while there, in the composition of the play ascribed to them.
Nathaniel Field above mentioned was celebrated in the
part of "Bussy D'Ambois," first printed in 1607. On the
republication of that play in 1641, he is thus spoken of in
the Prologue:&mdash;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
